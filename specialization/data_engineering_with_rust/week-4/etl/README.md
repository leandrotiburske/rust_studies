# ETL example

## Done

## To do

- Run the starting code to view the basic ETL flow and output

- Add an additional validation check that any values over 100 are set to 100 to prevent outliers

- Summarize the cleaned data by calculating the total and average after transformation

- Load the final clean data into a CSV file instead of a vector

- Handle potential errors in the transformation process using Result and pattern matching

- Add unit tests to validate the full ETL process using sample data
